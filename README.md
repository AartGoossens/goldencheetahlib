# GoldenCheetahLib
Python library that provides local access to activity data in GoldenCheetah.

**Important note**: This project is still in development and cannot be regarded 'stable' for now, but features will be added and bugs will be squashed. When the time is right, a stable version will be released.

## Introduction
Recently, GoldenCheetah got an embedded R Console (read about it [here](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_Working-with-R)) that got me wondering if something like this would be possible for Python as well. As it turnes out, it is: GoldenCheetah features a REST API that can be used to retrieve activity data. The API's functionality is basic but useful: 
- Get a list of all available athletes
- Get a list of all activities for an athlete
- Get athlete zones
- Get raw data for activities
- ...and some more

Full functionality can be found in the official documentation [here](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_REST-API-documentation).

The result is this project, *goldencheetahlib*. *goldencheetahlib* is basically a REST client that returns [Pandas Dataframes](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html.) with all your data.

## Requirements
- Python 3 (Python 2 support is not planned)
- GoldenCheetah >3.3 installed and running

## Installation
Install this library by running this command (preferably in your virtualenv):
```
pip install goldencheetahlib
```

## Getting started
First, make sure you meet the requirements. After that, clone this notebook in your project directory. If you have done this succesfully, these code snippets should get you started:
```python
%matplotlib inline
from goldencheetahlib.client import GoldenCheetahClient
```
```python
client = GoldenCheetahClient()
```
Find the names of all available athletes:
```python
client.get_athletes()
```
Set the athlete name in the client:
```python
client.athlete = 'John Doe'
```
(This can also be done by initializing the client with GoldenCheetahClient(athlete='John Doe')

Now you can start getting your data from GoldenCheetah:
```python
activity_list = client.get_activity_list()
```
```python
client.get_last_activity()
```
```python
activities = client.get_activity_bulk(activity_list.iloc[:10])
```

Because every returned activity and activity_list is a Pandas Dataframe interacting with them is really easy:
```python
activities.data[0].heartrate.mean()
activities.data[0].heartrate.plot()
```

Try it out!

(I will add a Jupyter notebook later with some more usage examples)
